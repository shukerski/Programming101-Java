The [Hello.java](https://github.com/shukerski/Programming101-Java/blob/master/week01/tuesday/Hello.java) file 
is how every programming course starts - with a Hello World program.  

The [Problems.java](https://github.com/shukerski/Programming101-Java/blob/master/week01/tuesday/Problems.java) file 
contains my solutions to the problems which we had to solve during the first lecture. 
You can check them out [here](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101-Java-2016/blob/master/week01/Tuesday/README.md).  

The [Anagrams.java](https://github.com/shukerski/Programming101-Java/blob/master/week01/tuesday/Anagrams.java) 
and [GPS.java](https://github.com/shukerski/Programming101-Java/blob/master/week01/tuesday/GPS.java) files 
contain my solutions to the **bonus** tasks we had to solve.  
You can see the Anagrams problem [here](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101-Java-2016/tree/master/week01/Anagrams) 
and GPS problem [here](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101-Java-2016/tree/master/week01/Gas-Stations).
